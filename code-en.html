    <p>I have been writing computer programs for more than 20 years, beginning with ZX Spectrum (Sinclair BASIC and Z80 machine code) and followed by Borland Pascal on PC. In the mid-1990s I mastered Object Pascal/Delphi, in which I wrote my first major projects, and in the beginning of 2000s I became interested in other languages, mainly C/C++ and Python, which became my primary development tools. Among my interests are high-performance computations and machine learning, including neural networks.</p>

    <h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>
    <p><b>MDVibCor</b> – a program for computing vibrational corrections for gas-phase electron diffraction using molecular dynamics data. Written in C++ with the usage of STL and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a> (console application for Linux and Windows). The initial development was in Edinburgh in 2008 (method description is published in [<a href="science-en.html#MD">14</a>]), then in Bielefeld (see ref. [<a href="science-en.html#MD-2">1</a>]). In 2013 the project has been placed on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/A1exander-Z/MDVibCor">project page</a>) under GPLv3 license.</p>
    <p><b>Z<sup>2</sup>IDP</b> – a program for data reduction of gas-phase electron diffraction images obtained by scanning diffraction patterns. Written in C++ with the use of Qt (Linux and Windows versions). Method description is given in ref. [<a href="science-en.html#IDP-2">6</a>, <a href="science-en.html#IDP-1">11</a>]). Previous variants of this software, XIDP (C++ and wxWidgets, Linux and Windows versions) and IDP (Delphi, Windows) were designed for processing data from the MD-100 microdensitometer (method description can be found in ref. [<a href="science-en.html#100-2">21</a>]).</p>
    <p><b>A set of utilities</b> for simplifying computations of vibrational corrections using the SHRINK program (Q2SHRINK – input file generation, SHREx – data extraction from output files, ExPED – extraction of potential energy distributions). Written in Python, the description is in ref. [<a href="science-en.html#SHR">13</a>].</p>
    <p><b>Personal website</b>, which you are reading (HTML, CSS3)</p>
    <p><b>MD100</b> – A program for control and data acquisition for the MD-100 automated microdensitometer. Written in Borland Pascal, has been used for scanning diffraction patterns in the <a href="http://main.isuct.ru/ru/niitik/ediffraction">ISUCT laboratory of gas-phase electron diffraction</a> for 15 years. The description of the microdensitometer and the technique is published in [<a href="science-en.html#100-2">21</a>, <a href="science-en.html#100-1">29</a>]. It became obsolete due to transition to scanning diffraction patterns using a commercial scanner.</p>
    <p><b>AZ's Book Reader</b> – a program for reading e-books (probably one of the first). It waswritten in 1997 in Delphi, distributed as freeware, and supported only ASCII texts (in several encodings) and working with archives (mainly for texts distributed through Fido newsgroups). It became completely obsolete with the appearance of CoolReader, FBReader, FictionBook format, etc., the last version was released in 2000. Curiously enough, it is still available for downloading in the Internet.</p>
